  <p id="tracklist">The tracklist for my mother's 24th birthday.
    24 songs, varying in genre and style, but all precisely curated to help speak my dad's mind.
    This list had a bit of my mom's jamaican dancehall, my dad's rock, and some well timed interludes.

      "Pretty sure it was my first time using photoshop, and it was fun to mess with! Now you can obviously see where your design skills must come from."

  <p id="outerfirstcassette"> These albums had about 100 or so playthroughs before the tape broke, so their run was fairly limited.</p3>

"Sure was..." (referencing this being her best birthday) "I always had this one going in the car, wow..."    </p>
